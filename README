  COMPASS-SASS
================
This particular branch stores a clean rails app that is setup using compass/sass. It uses the blueprint framework and haml. The styleshees generated with compass are stored in app/stylesheets, while the application stylesheet (generated with nifty layout) is in public/stylesheets/sass/application.sass. 

To generate controllers and models that consistently use haml/sass, use nifty generator with the --haml option. Example:
  # Generate a controller and view without a model using haml named style_me with one index action
  rails g nifty:scaffold style_me index --haml --skip-model

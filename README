 FB_GRAPH_CACHE
================
This repository stores the source code of the blog entries of my website. This particular branch stores the fb_graph_cache demo. This is a demo to demonstrate how to cache information pulled from facebook using the fb_graph gem api into a local database. It builds on the fb_graph_gem demo.  

To run this demo:

 1. clone the repository and checkout the remote branch "fb_graph_cache": 
       `git checkout -b fb_graph_cache origin/fb_graph_cache`
 2. Run `bundle install` to install the required gems. 
 3. Run `rake db:migrate` to create the databases. 
 4. Run `$RAILS_ROOT/jobs/wrap_facebook_update.sh` to poll events from a dummy facebook page
 5. Run `rake server` to start the web server
 6. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see the demo.

The blog post about this demo is here:
